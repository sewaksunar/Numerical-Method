This note covers the **Solution of System of Linear Algebraic Equations**, a fundamental area of numerical methods used in engineering to model systems such as structures, electric circuits, and fluid networks.

### **2.1 Direct Methods**
Direct methods compute the solution in a finite number of operations. The general form of a linear system is **$[A]\{X\} = \{B\}$**, where $[A]$ is the coefficient matrix, $\{X\}$ is the vector of unknowns, and $\{B\}$ is the vector of constants.

#### **2.1.1 Gauss Elimination and Pivoting**
This method reduces the system to an **upper triangular form** through forward elimination and then solves for unknowns via **back substitution**.
*   **Forward Elimination:** The objective is to eliminate $x_1$ from the second to the $n$th equation, then $x_2$ from the third to $n$th, and so on.
    *   **Multiplier formula:** 
    $$
    f_{ik} = \frac{a_{ik}} {a_{kk}}
    $$

    *   **Row transformation:** 
    $$
    a_{ij}^{new} = a_{ij} - f_{ik} \cdot a_{kj}$$
    and 
    $$
    b_i^{new} = b_i - f_{ik} \cdot b_k
    $$

*   **Back Substitution:** Once the matrix is triangular, unknowns are solved from the bottom up.
    *   **Formula:** 
    $$
    x_n = \frac{b_n}{a_{nn}} 
    $$ 
    and 
    $$
    x_i = \frac{b_i - \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij}x_j}{a_{ii}}
    $$

>**Pivoting Strategies:** "Naive" Gauss elimination fails if a pivot element ($a_{kk}$) is zero. **Partial Pivoting** involves switching the pivot row with the row below it that contains the largest absolute coefficient in the pivot column to avoid division by zero and minimize round-off errors.
To get a pivot row or column, you typically follow strategies designed to ensure numerical stability and avoid division by zero during processes like Gauss elimination or LU decomposition.

##### **1. Getting the Pivot Row (Partial Pivoting)**
The goal is to find the **largest absolute value** in the current column to serve as the pivot element.

*   For a system at the $k$th step of elimination, search the current column ($k$) starting from the diagonal element ($a_{kk}$) down to the bottom of the column.
*   Identify the element in that column with the largest absolute magnitude. The row containing this element is your new **pivot row**.
*  Switch this identified row with the current row $k$. This ensures that you are dividing by the largest possible number, which minimizes round-off errors and prevents division by zero if the original $a_{kk}$ was zero.

##### **2. Getting the Pivot Row and Column (Complete Pivoting)**
Complete pivoting is more thorough but rarely used due to its complexity.

*   **How to identify it:** Instead of looking only at the current column, search the **entire remaining submatrix** (all rows and columns that have not yet been used as pivots).
*   **The Selection Rule:** Find the single largest absolute value in this entire block of numbers.
*   **The Action:** 
    1.  Switch the row containing that element with the current row $k$ (to get the **pivot row**).
    2.  Switch the column containing that element with the current column $k$ (to get the **pivot column**).
*   **Note:** Switching columns changes the order of your unknowns ($x_1, x_2, \dots$), so you must keep track of these changes to correctly identify the solution at the end.


##### **Summary Table for Linear Algebra**
| Strategy | Search Area | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Naive** | None (uses current diagonal) | Speed (but unstable if diagonal is 0) |
| **Partial** | Column below current diagonal | Largest absolute value in column |
| **Complete** | Entire remaining submatrix | Largest absolute value in the submatrix |

#### **2.1.2 Gauss-Jordan Method**
A variation where unknowns are eliminated from **all equations** (above and below the pivot), and each row is normalised by its pivot element. This transforms the coefficient matrix directly into an **identity matrix**, yielding the solution in the constant vector $\{B\}$ without requiring back substitution. It requires approximately 50% more operations than standard Gauss elimination.

#### **2.1.3 Factorization methods**
Every square matrix A with all non-zeros principle mnors can e factored uniquely into a lower triangular matrix $L$ and upper triangular matrix $U$ as, 
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    [A] = [L][U]
    \end{equation}
    $$

**Method:** Consider the system of linear equations:
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n} x_n &= b_1 \\
    a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n} x_n &= b_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    a_{n1} x_1 + a_{n2} x_2 + \cdots + a_{nn} x_n &= b_n
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    $$
which can be written as:
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    [A][X] = [B]
    \end{equation}
    $$
where
    $$
    [A] = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
    \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
    [X] = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
    [B] = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix}
    $$

Then, $[A] = [L][U]$ also, can be reduced to:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    ([L][U])[X] &= [B] \notag \\
    [L]([U][X]) &= [B] \notag \\
    [L][V] &= [B]
    \end{align}
    $$
Where
Solving (4), from $[V]$ and using it in $(1)$ we get the solution $[X]$.

1. Do-Little’s method:
    Consider a $3 \times 3$ system,
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    [A] &= \begin{bmatrix}
            a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
            a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
            a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
            \end{bmatrix} \\
    [L] &= \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0 \\
            l_{21} & 1 & 0 \\
            l_{31} & l_{32} & 1
            \end{bmatrix} \\
    [U] &= \begin{bmatrix}
            u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\
            0 & u_{22} & u_{23} \\
            0 & 0 & u_{33}
            \end{bmatrix}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **2.2 Iterative Methods**
Iterative methods start with an initial guess and refine it until the solution converges within a tolerance.

#### 2.2.1 Jacobi’s Method (Method of Simultaneous Displacement):
It uses only values from the **previous iteration** to calculate the new set of estimates, waiting until the entire iteration is complete to update variables.
**Iterative formula:**
$$
\begin{equation}
x_i = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left( b_i - \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^n a_{ij}x_j \right)
\end{equation}
$$

**Convergence Criterion:** Convergence is guaranteed if the matrix is **diagonally dominant**:
$$
|a_{ii}| > \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^n |a_{ij}|
$$

#### 2.2.2 Gauss-Seidel Method:
The most common iterative technique, which **immediately uses the latest available estimates** for each unknown as they are computed.


### **2.3 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (The Power Method)**
Eigenvalue problems are expressed as **$[A]\{X\} = \lambda\{X\}$**, where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $\{X\}$ is the eigenvector.
*   **Largest Eigenvalue:** The **Power Method** iteratively multiplies a guess vector by the matrix and normalizes the result until it converges to the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding vector.
*   **Smallest Eigenvalue:** Determined by applying the power method to the **inverse matrix $[A]^{-1}$**; the result is the reciprocal of the smallest eigenvalue.

---

### **Practical Implementation (Python)**
The syllabus requires implementing these algorithms in **Python**, utilizing libraries like **NumPy** and **SciPy**:
*   `numpy.linalg.solve(A, y)`: Solves linear systems using LU decomposition.
*   `scipy.linalg.lu(A)`: Returns the permutation matrix $P$, and the $L$ and $U$ factors.
*   `numpy.linalg.eig(A)`: Computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*   `numpy.linalg.inv(A)`: Computes the matrix inverse.
