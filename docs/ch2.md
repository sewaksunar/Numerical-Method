# Chapter 2: System of Linear Equations

This note covers the **Solution of System of Linear Algebraic Equations**, a fundamental area of numerical methods used in engineering to model systems such as structures, electric circuits, and fluid networks.

### **2.1 Direct Methods**
Direct methods compute the solution in a finite number of operations. The general form of a linear system is $[A]\{X\} = \{B\}$, where $[A]$ is the coefficient matrix, $\{X\}$ is the vector of unknowns, and $\{B\}$ is the vector of constants.

#### **2.1.1 Gauss Elimination and Pivoting**
This method reduces the system to an **upper triangular form** through forward elimination and then solves for unknowns via **back substitution**.
*   **Forward Elimination:** The objective is to eliminate $x_1$ from the second to the $n$th equation, then $x_2$ from the third to $n$th, and so on.
    *   **Multiplier formula:** 
    $
    f_{ik} = \frac{a_{ik}} {a_{kk}}
    $

    *   **Row transformation:** 
    $
    a_{ij}^{new} = a_{ij} - f_{ik} \cdot a_{kj}$$
    and 
    $
    b_i^{new} = b_i - f_{ik} \cdot b_k
    $

*   **Back Substitution:** Once the matrix is triangular, unknowns are solved from the bottom up.
    *   **Formula:** 
    $$
    x_n = \frac{b_n}{a_{nn}} 
    $$ 
    and 
    $$
    x_i = \frac{b_i - \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij}x_j}{a_{ii}}
    $$

**Pivoting Strategies:** "Naive" Gauss elimination fails if a pivot element ($a_{kk}$) is zero. Partial Pivoting involves switching the pivot row with the row below it that contains the largest absolute coefficient in the pivot column to avoid division by zero and minimize round-off errors.

To get a pivot row or column, you typically follow strategies designed to ensure numerical stability and avoid division by zero during processes like Gauss elimination or LU decomposition.
```

##### **1. Getting the Pivot Row (Partial Pivoting)**
The goal is to find the **largest absolute value** in the current column to serve as the pivot element.

*   For a system at the $k$th step of elimination, search the current column ($k$) starting from the diagonal element ($a_{kk}$) down to the bottom of the column.
    *   Identify the element in that column with the largest absolute magnitude. The row containing this element is your new pivot row.
    *   Switch this identified row with the current row $k$. This ensures that you are dividing by the largest possible number, which minimizes round-off errors and prevents division by zero if the original $a_{kk}$ was zero.

##### **2. Getting the Pivot Row and Column (Complete Pivoting)**
Complete pivoting is more thorough but rarely used due to its complexity.

*   **How to identify it:** Instead of looking only at the current column, search the **entire remaining submatrix** (all rows and columns that have not yet been used as pivots).
*   **The Selection Rule:** Find the single largest absolute value in this entire block of numbers.
*   **The Action:** 
    1.  Switch the row containing that element with the current row $k$ (to get the **pivot row**).
    2.  Switch the column containing that element with the current column $k$ (to get the **pivot column**).
*   **Note:** Switching columns changes the order of your unknowns ($x_1, x_2, \dots$), so you must keep track of these changes to correctly identify the solution at the end.


##### **Summary Table for Linear Algebra**
| Strategy | Search Area | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Naive** | None (uses current diagonal) | Speed (but unstable if diagonal is 0) |
| **Partial** | Column below current diagonal | Largest absolute value in column |
| **Complete** | Entire remaining submatrix | Largest absolute value in the submatrix |


#### **2.1.2 Gauss-Jordan Method**
A variation where unknowns are eliminated from **all equations** (above and below the pivot), and each row is normalised by its pivot element. This transforms the coefficient matrix directly into an **identity matrix**, yielding the solution in the constant vector $\{B\}$ without requiring back substitution. It requires approximately 50% more operations than standard Gauss elimination.

#### 2.1.3 Matrix inverse using Gauss Jordan and Gauss elimination methods
##### 2.1.3.1 Gauss Jordan Methods

Gauss-Jordan elimination transforms the coefficient matrix into an identity matrix.

#### 2.1.3.2 Factorization methods
Every square matrix $A$ with all non-zero principal minors can be factored uniquely into a lower triangular matrix $L$ and upper triangular matrix $U$ as:

$$[A] = [L][U]$$

**Method:** Consider the system of linear equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n} x_n &= b_1 \\
a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n} x_n &= b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{n1} x_1 + a_{n2} x_2 + \cdots + a_{nn} x_n &= b_n
\end{aligned}$$

which can be written as:

$$[A][X] = [B]$$
where

$$[A] = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}, \qquad
[X] = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
[B] = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix}$$

Then, if $[A] = [L][U]$, the system can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{align}
([L][U])[X] &= [B] \\
[L]([U][X]) &= [B] \\
[L][V] &= [B]
\end{align}
$$

where we define $[V] = [U][X]$.

**Solution Steps:**
1. Solve $[L][V] = [B]$ for $[V]$ (forward substitution)
2. Solve $[U][X] = [V]$ for $[X]$ (back substitution)

**Example:** Consider a $3 \times 3$ system:
    $$
    [A] = \begin{bmatrix}
            a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
            a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
            a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
            \end{bmatrix}
    $$

**Do-Little's method:**
    $$
    [L] = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0 \\
            l_{21} & 1 & 0 \\
            l_{31} & l_{32} & 1
            \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
    [U] = \begin{bmatrix}
            u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\
            0 & u_{22} & u_{23} \\
            0 & 0 & u_{33}
            \end{bmatrix}
    $$

**Crout's method:**
    $$
    [L] = \begin{bmatrix}
            l_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
            l_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\
            l_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}
            \end{bmatrix} , \qquad
    [U] = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & u_{12} & u_{13} \\
            0 & 1 & u_{23} \\
            0 & 0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}
    $$

### **2.2 Iterative Methods**
Iterative methods start with an initial guess and refine it until the solution converges within a tolerance.

#### 2.2.1 Jacobi’s Method (Method of Simultaneous Displacement):
It uses only values from the **previous iteration** to calculate the new set of estimates, waiting until the entire iteration is complete to update variables.
**Iterative formula:**
$$
\begin{equation}
x_i = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left( b_i - \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^n a_{ij}x_j \right)
\end{equation}
$$

**Convergence Criterion:** Convergence is guaranteed if the matrix is **diagonally dominant**:
$$
|a_{ii}| > \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^n |a_{ij}|
$$

#### 2.2.2 Gauss-Seidel Method:
The most common iterative technique, which **immediately uses the latest available estimates** for each unknown as they are computed.

If $x = x_{1}^{(n)}, x_{2}^{(n)}, x_{3}^{(n)}, \cdots, x_{n}^{(n)}$ be the $n^{th}$ approximation to the system (2), then the $ (n+1)^{th}$ approximation to the root is given by, 
$$
\begin{align*}
x_{1}^{(n+1)} &= \frac{1}{a_{11}}[b_{1} - a_{12}x_{2}^{(n)} - a_{13}x_{3}^{(n)} - \cdots - a_{1n}x_{n}^{(n)}] \\
x_{2}^{(n+1)} &= \frac{1}{a_{22}}[b_{2} - a_{21}x_{1}^{(n+1)} - a_{23}x_{3}^{(n)} - \cdots - a_{2n}x_{n}^{(n)}] \\
\vdots \\
x_{n}^{(n+1)} &= \frac{1}{a_{nn}}[b_{n} - a_{n1}x_{1}^{(n+1)} - a_{n2}x_{2}^{(n+1)} - \cdots - a_{n(n-1)}x_{n-1}^{(n+1)}]
\end{align*}
$$

### **2.3 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (The Power Method)**
**Largest Eigenvalue:** The **Power Method** iteratively multiplies a guess vector by the matrix and normalizes the result until it converges to the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding vector.


Given a square matrix $A$. Let $X^{(0)}$ be the initial vector so that 
$$Y^{(1)} =AX^{(0)}$$
then, 
$$
AX^{(0)} = \lambda_{1} X^{(1)} \\ 
AX^{(1)} = \lambda_{2} X^{(2)} \\ 
\vdots \\
AX^{(n)} = \lambda_{n+1} X^{(n+1)} \\ 
$$
Which can be written, 
$$
X^{(1)} = \frac{1}{k_{1}}Y^{(1)} \\ 
X^{(2)} = \frac{1}{k_{2}} X^{(2)} \\ 
\vdots \\
X^{(n)} = \frac{1}{k_{n}} X^{(n)} \\ 
$$
where $k_n$ is the absolutely largest element of $Y^{(n)}$. Then the sequence $k_1, k_2, \cdots, k_n$ converges to the numerically dominant eigenvalues of matrix $A$. The $X^{(n)}$ is the corresponding eigenvector of $\lambda_{n}$.

**Smallest Eigenvalue:** Determined by applying the power method to the **inverse matrix $[A]^{-1}$**; the result is the reciprocal of the smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigen vector.
